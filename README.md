improvements
-------------
Before starting the game each player would be able to assign the X or O to their team name. There is a lot to be desired in regards to the interface design. Future versions would have a stone as a place keeper (different colors or types) in place of the X and O's. 
When one game is won there would be a button to initiate a new game while keeping a tally under the team name of who won the previous games.
